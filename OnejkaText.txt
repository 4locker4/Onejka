The less we love a woman
  the easier 'tis to be liked by her,
  and thus more surely we undo her
 4 among bewitching toils.
  Time was when cool debauch
  was lauded as the art of love,
  trumpeting everywhere about itself,
 8 taking its pleasure without loving.
  But that grand game
  is worthy of old sapajous
  of our forefathers' vaunted times;
12 the fame of Lovelaces has faded
  with the fame of red heels
  and of majestic periwigs.
VIII

  Who does not find it tedious to dissemble;
  diversely to repeat the same;
  try gravely to convince one
 4 of what all have been long convinced;
  to hear the same objections,
  annihilate the prejudices
  which never had and hasn't
 8 a little girl of thirteen years!
  Who will not grow weary of threats,
  entreaties, vows, feigned fear,
  notes running to six pages,
12 betrayals, gossiping, rings, tears,
  surveillances of aunts, of mothers,
  and the onerous friendship of husbands!
IX

  Exactly thus my Eugene thought.
  In his first youth
  he had been victim of tempestuous errings
 4 and of unbridled passions.
  Spoiled by a habitude of life,
  with one thing for a while
  enchanted, disenchanted with another,
 8 irked slowly by desire,
  irked, too, by volatile success,
  hearkening in the hubbub and the hush
  to the eternal mutter of his soul,
12 smothering yawns with laughter:
  this was the way he killed eight years,
  having lost life's best bloom.
X

  With belles no longer did he fall in love,
  but dangled after them just anyhow;
  when they refused, he solaced in a twinkle;
 4 when they betrayed, was glad to rest.
  He sought them without rapture,
  while he left them without regret,
  hardly remembering their love and spite.
 8 Exactly thus does an indifferent guest
  drive up for evening whist:
  sits down; then, when the game is over,
  he drives off from the place,
12 at home falls peacefully asleep,
  and in the morning does not know himself
  where he will drive to in the evening.
XI

  But on receiving Tanya's missive,
  Onegin was profoundly touched:
  the language of a maiden's daydreams
 4 stirred up in him a swarm of thoughts;
  and he recalled winsome Tatiana's
  pale color, mournful air;
  and in a sweet and sinless dream
 8 his soul became absorbed.
  Perhaps an ancient glow of feelings
  possessed him for a minute;
  but he did not wish to deceive
12 an innocent soul's trustfulness.
  Now we'll flit over to the garden where Tatiana
  encountered him.
XII

  For a few seconds they were silent;
  Onegin then went up to her
  and quoth: “You wrote to me.
 4 Do not deny it. I have read
  a trustful soul's avowals,
  an innocent love's outpourings;
  your candidness appeals to me,
 8 in me it has excited
  emotions long grown silent.
  But I don't want to praise you —
  I will repay you for it
12 with an avowal likewise void of art;
  hear my confession;
  unto your judgment I submit.
XIII

  “If I by the domestic circle
  had wanted to bound life;
  if to be father, husband,
 4 a pleasant lot had ordered me;
  if with the familistic picture
  I were but for one moment captivated;
  then, doubtlessly, save you alone
 8 no other bride I'd seek.
  I'll say without madrigal spangles:
  my past ideal having found,
  I'd doubtlessly have chosen you alone
12 for mate of my sad days, in gage
  of all that's beautiful, and would have been
  happy — in so far as I could!
XIV

  “But I'm not made for bliss;
  my soul is strange to it;
  in vain are your perfections:
 4 I'm not at all worthy of them.
  Believe me (conscience is thereof the pledge),
  wedlock to us would be a torment.
  However much I loved you,
 8 having grown used, I'd cease to love at once;
  you would begin to weep; your tears
  would fail to touch my heart —
  they merely would exasperate it.
12 Judge, then, what roses
  Hymen would lay in store for us —
  and, possibly, for many days!
XV

  “What in the world can be
  worse than a family where the poor wife frets
  over an undeserving husband
 4 and day and evening is alone;
  where the dull husband,
  knowing her worth (yet cursing fate),
  is always sullen, silent, cross,
 8 and coldly jealous?
  Thus I. And is it this you sought
  with pure flaming soul when
  with such simplicity,
12 with such intelligence, to me you wrote?
  Can it be true that such a portion
  is by stern fate assigned to you?
XVI

  “For dreams and years there's no return;
  I shall not renovate my soul.
  I love you with a brother's love
 4 and maybe still more tenderly.
  So listen to me without wrath:
  a youthful maid will more than once
  for dreams exchange light dreams;
 8 a sapling thus its leaves
  changes with every spring.
  By heaven thus 'tis evidently destined.
  Again you will love; but.
12 learn to control yourself;
  not everyone as I will understand you;
  to trouble inexperience leads.”
XVII

  Thus Eugene preached.
  Nought seeing through her tears,
  scarce breathing, without protests,
 4 Tatiana listened to him.
  His arm to her he offered. Sadly
  (as it is said: “mechanically”),
  Tatiana leaned on it in silence,
 8 bending her languid little head;
  homeward [they] went around the kitchen garden;
  together they arrived, and none
  dreamt of reproving them for this:
12 its happy rights
  has country freedom
  as well as haughty Moscow has.
XVIII

  You will agree, my reader,
  that very nicely did our pal
  act toward melancholy Tanya;
 4 not for the first time here did he reveal
  a real nobility of soul,
  though people's ill will
  spared nothing in him:
 8 his foes, his friends
  (which, maybe, are the same)
  upbraided him this way and that.
  Foes upon earth has everyone,
12 but God preserve us from our friends!
  Ah me, those friends, those friends!
  Not without cause have I recalled them.
XIX

  What's that? Oh, nothing. I am lulling
  empty black reveries;
  I only in parenthesis observe
 4 that there's no despicable slander
  spawned in a garret by a babbler
  and by the rabble of the monde encouraged,
  that there's no such absurdity,
 8 nor vulgar epigram,
  that with a smile your friend
  in a circle of decent people
  without the slightest malice or design
12 will not repeat a hundred times in error;
  yet he professes to stand up for you:
  he loves you so!... Oh, like a kinsman!
XX

  Hm, hm, gent reader,
  are all your kindred well?
  Allow me; you might want, perhaps,
 4 to learn from me now what exactly
  is meant by “kinsfolks”?
  Well, here's what kinsfolks are:
  we are required to pet them, love them,
 8 esteem them cordially,
  and, following popular custom,
  come Christmas, visit them, or else
  congratulate them postally,
12 so that for the remainder of the year
  they will not think about us.
  So grant them, God, long life!
XXI

  As to the love of tender beauties,
   'tis surer than friendship or kin:
  even mid restless tempests you retain
 4 rights over it.
  No doubt, so. But one has to reckon
  with fashion's whirl, with nature's waywardness,
  with the stream of the monde's opinion —
 8 while the sweet sex is light as fluff.
  Moreover, the opinions of her husband
  should by a virtuous wife
  be always honored;
12 your faithful mistress thus
  may in a trice be swept away:
  with love jokes Satan.
XXII

   Whom, then, to love? Whom to believe?
  Who is the only one that won't betray us?
  Who measures all deeds and all speeches
 4 obligingly by our own foot rule?
  Who does not sow slander about us?
  Who coddles us with care?
  To whom our vice is not so bad?
 8 Who never bores us?
  Efforts in vain not wasting
  (as would a futile phantom-seeker),
  love your own self,
12 my worthly honored reader.
  A worthy object! Surely, nothing
  more amiable exists.
XXIII

  What was the consequence of the interview?
  Alas, it is not hard to guess!
  Love's frenzied sufferings
 4 did not stop agitating
  the youthful soul avid of sadness;
  nay, poor Tatiana more intensely
  with joyless passion burns;
 8 sleep shuns her bed;
  health, life's bloom and its sweetness,
  smile, virginal tranquillity —
  all, like an empty sound, have ceased to be,
12 and gentle Tanya's youth is darkling:
  thus a storm's shadow clothes
  the scarce-born day.
XXIV

  Alas, Tatiana fades away,
  grows pale, is wasting, and is mute!
  Nothing beguiles her
 4 or moves her soul.
  Shaking gravely their heads,
  among themselves the neighbors whisper:
  Time, time she married!...
 8 But that will do. I must make haste
  to cheer the imagination with the picture
  of happy love.
  I cannot help, my dears,
12 being constrained by pity;
  forgive me: I do love so much
  my dear Tatiana!
XXV

  From hour to hour more captivated
  by the attractions of young Olga,
  Vladimir to delicious thralldom
 4 fully gave up his soul.
  He's ever with her. In her chamber
  they sit together in the dark;
  or in the garden, arm in arm,
 8 they stroll at morningtide;
  and what of it? With love intoxicated,
  in the confusion of a tender shame,
  he only dares sometimes,
12 by Olga's smile encouraged,
  play with an unwound curl
  or kiss the border of her dress.
XXVI

  Sometimes he reads to Olya
  a moralistic novel —
  in which the author
 4 knows nature better than Chateaubriand —
  and, meanwhile, two-three pages
  (empty chimeras, fables,
  for hearts of maidens dangerous)
 8 he blushingly leaves out.
  Retiring far from everybody,
  over the chessboard they,
  leaning their elbows on the table,
12 at times sit deep in thought,
  and Lenski in abstraction takes
  with a pawn his own rook.
XXVII

  When he drives home, at home he also
  is with his Olga occupied,
  the volatile leaves of an album
 4 assiduously adorns for her:
  now draws therein agrestic views,
  a gravestone, the temple of Cypris,
  or a dove on a lyre
 8 (using a pen and, slightly, colors);
  now on the pages of remembrance,
  beneath the signatures of others,
  he leaves a tender verse —
12 mute monument of reverie,
  an instant thought's light trace,
  still, after many years, the same.
XXVIII

  You have, of course, seen more than once the album
  of a provincial miss, by all her girl friends
  scrawled over from the end,
 4 from the beginning, and around.
  Here, in defiance of orthography,
  lines without meter, [passed on] by tradition,
  in token of faithful friendship are entered,
 8 diminished, lengthened.
  On the first leaf you are confronted with:
   Qu' écrirez-vous sur ces tablettes?
  signed: toute à vous Annette;
12 and on the last one you will read:
  “Whoever more than I loves you,
  let him write farther than I do.”
XXIX

  Here you are sure to find
  two hearts, a torch, and flowerets;
  here you will read no doubt
 4 love's vows “Unto the tomb slab”;
  some military poetaster
  here has dashed off a roguish rhyme.
  In such an album, to be frank, my friends,
 8 I too am glad to write,
  at heart being convinced
  that any zealous trash of mine
  will merit an indulgent glance
12 and that thereafter, with a wicked smile,
  one will not solemnly examine
  if I could babble wittily or not.
XXX

  But you, odd volumes
  from the bibliotheca of the devils,
  the gorgeous albums,
 4 the rack of fashionable rhymesters;
  you, nimbly ornamented
  by Tolstoy's wonder-working brush,
  or Baratïnski's pen,
 8 let the Lord's levin burn you!
  Whenever her in-quarto a resplendent lady
  proffers to me,
  a tremor and a waspishness possess me,
12 and at the bottom of my soul
  there stirs an epigram —
  but madrigals you have to write for them!

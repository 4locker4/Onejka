The less we love a woman
  the easier 'tis to be liked by her,
  and thus more surely we undo her
 4 among bewitching toils.
  Time was when cool debauch
  was lauded as the art of love,
  trumpeting everywhere about itself,
 8 taking its pleasure without loving.
  But that grand game
  is worthy of old sapajous
  of our forefathers' vaunted times;
12 the fame of Lovelaces has faded
  with the fame of red heels
  and of majestic periwigs.
